DocStruct - Tool

Running .\src\main.py with no commandline arguments will parse all files (assumed to only be HTML files)
located in the .\data\ directory, and output XML files containing Document Structures in the \.output\
directory.  If commandline options are specified, the first argument is considered the 'data' directory,
and the second the 'output' directory.  If an HTML file cannot be parsed because it contains invalid
markup or characters, the filename of the offending file will be logged to a file entitled 'error.log'
in the current working directory.
